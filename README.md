# QuizApp-Kotlin
This is a simple quiz app created with Kotlin on Android Studio
This is my first ever app created.
It is a simple app that quizzes users on flags of countries.
After reading extensively on Android development, I immediately dived into building my first project
I focused mainly on learning and implementing XML in creating the UI of the app.
Layouts are mainly linear because most of the views in the app are vertically arranged.
I will just leave this here for now and come back to improve when I have improved in android development.
